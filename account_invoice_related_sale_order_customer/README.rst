========================================
Related Customer of Invoice's sale order
========================================

Normally the customer of an invoice's sale order does not exist on invoice.
This Module adds that customer to invoice and changes the string of original
customer of an invoice to "Invoice address", when it previously was "Customer".

The new customer field from sale order is shown with the string "Customer" on
invoice.
