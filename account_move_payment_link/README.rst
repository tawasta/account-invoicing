===================================
Invoice: Autogenerated Payment Link
===================================

* By default, Odoo has a "Generate Payment Link" button in the invoice form's Action menu
* This module runs that core functionality when the user clicks Send & Print, and stores the
  link into a new field for the invoice, making it embeddable in the e-mail template.
* With the link, the user can pay their invoice directly through the system with a few
  less clicks (compared to core invoice portal payment functionality), without needing to 
  open the invoice's portal view first.

Installation
============
* Just install this module

Configuration
=============
* Configure the e-mail template to contain the payment link. Depending on the use case, you can 
  either modify the email template directly (usually "Invoice: Send by email"), or if you want to
  override the Odoo standard email wrapper layout that contains the "View Document" link, you can use OCA's 
  mail_layout_force module, create a custom wrapper layout, and call "record.payment_link" from there.
  The latter is the recommended option, so that the email will only contain one link.

Usage
=====
* After the invoice email template has been configured, go to a draft customer invoice form and
  click Send & Print. 
* The link gets generated in the background, and you can send the invoice to the customer 
  as usual.
* After generation, you can view the link on the form in Other Info sheet

Known issues / Roadmap
======================
* None
