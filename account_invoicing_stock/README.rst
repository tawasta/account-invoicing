Account invoicing stock
=======================

* When the first pre-invoice is created, order transfers are attached to the invoice. At the same time make transfers not urgent.

* Added action button to Transfers view which you can see the number of invoices and view invoices.

* When the invoice is paid, check if all the invoices for the related transfer (s) have been paid and if so, then the status of the transfer is changed to normal.
