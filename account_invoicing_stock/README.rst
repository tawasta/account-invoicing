Account invoicing stock
=======================

* Adds link between invoices and their pickings

* When a down payment invoice is created from sale, pickings are set as priority 4

* Adds an action button to Transfers, from which you can view the related invoices.

* When the invoice is paid, check if all the invoices for the related transfer(s) have been paid.
  If they are, then the status of the transfer is changed to normal (1).
